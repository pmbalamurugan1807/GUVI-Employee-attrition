# GUVI-Employee-attrition

Streamlit project to show employee attrition with EDA and model training 

(Note: entire project is done in 1 python file(employeeattrition.py)

step 1: This involves processing of data(Employee-Attrition.csv) into a format thats more easier to model for predictions which are mainly binary encoding and one hot encoding

step 2: Next step is staring to code for streamlit alongside modelling but starting with the sidebar with "Dataset Overview", "EDA and its Visualization", "Model Training & Evaluation", "Predict Attrition", "Predict Performance Rating" options all of which denote each page 

step 3: Starting with data overview , this page is mainly to overview the data which shows the missing values and the summary of data distribution
